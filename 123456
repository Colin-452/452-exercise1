        <h4>The basie ideas</h4>
        <p>Reproducibility is an important concept in science.If one experimenter demonstrates a
        <br>phenomenon, someone else ought to be able to repeat the experiment and get the same results. If
        <br>they get different results, the original results may have been a fluke, or something relevant must
        <br>have been different between the two experiments.</p>
        <h4>The reproducibility crisis in psychology</h4>
        <p>In recent years, some fields have been dealing with a "reproducibility crisis" &ndash;&ndash; results which
        <br>everyone thought were true have failed to replicate. The <span class="emph">reproducibility project</span> was one major
        <br>effort to to reproduce old experimental results; it is discussed on <a href="http://www.econtalk.org/archives/2015/11/brian nosek on.html " target="_blank">this podcast</a> .</p>
        <h4>Reasons why this happens</h4>
        <ul>
        <li>Publication bias (boring results unlikely to be published)</li>
        <li>Statistics used (e.g.p&lt; 0.05) can exaggerate the strength of the evidencee</li>
        <li>distance of 700 kilometres.</li>
        <li>...and much more...</li>
